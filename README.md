## Organization

There were two hands-on sessions :

- The first one is about simple image processing and getting used with the notebook system [here](https://github.com/SeguinBe/DHWorkshop2017/blob/master/first-session/WS-DH17.ipynb).
- The second one was about [face detection and recognition](https://github.com/SeguinBe/DHWorkshop2017/blob/master/second-session/Faces/Face%20Detection%20and%20Identification.ipynb) and using [generic Neural Network features as a first approach for any vision task](https://github.com/SeguinBe/DHWorkshop2017/blob/master/second-session/Generic%20CNN/Generic%20Convolutional%20Features.ipynb).
